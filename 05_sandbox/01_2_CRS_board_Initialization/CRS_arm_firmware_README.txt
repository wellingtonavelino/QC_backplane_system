Flashing TCPipe ARM firmware on the CRS
---------------------------------------

Note: The instructions below are for Ubuntu

Prerequisites

- Vitis must be installed
- The CRS board must be connected to the host computer using the micro-USB cable
- The CRS board must be powered on
- minicom must be installed


To program the flash, activate the Vitis environment, go to the CRS firmware image folder, and run the Vitis programming comamnd::

	source /tools/Xilinx/Vitis/2022.2/settings64.sh
	cd pychfpga/pychfpga/hardware/crs/arm_firmware
    program_flash -f BOOT.bin -offset 0 -flash_type qspi-x8-dual_parallel -fsbl fsbl.elf -blank_check -verify


The ``-blank_check`` and ``-verify`` options can be omitted to accelerate the programming.

To check the programming:

1) Connect the ethernet port of the CRS to a network with a local DHCP sever.
2) Launch minicom on the serial TTY port::

	    minicom -D /dev/ttyUSB1

	 Press ``CTRL-A`` ``u`` to enable adding linefeeds to carriage returns

3) Power cycle the CRS
4) Check minicom ooutput. Should look like::

Notes
-----

 2024-10-23: Programming failed on CRS 011.

   - Launched Hardware manager on Vivado and could see ARM & FPGA, and monitor ARM temperatures. So cable & JTAG is good.
   - Launched Vitis. tested target: can see FPGA.
   - Compiled TCPIPE. Created boot.bin (design was for ZCU111, had to change FSBL etc.). programmed flash. had wrong flash type, fixed it. reprogrammed, worked, verify is OK but says programming failed on last line. Does ot boot properly on minicom.
   - Retry script with image in arm_firmware. Still error on final line, but otherwise programming seems ok now. Reboot. minicom shows normal boot. Can connect with pychfpga.
   - Not sure what fixed the problem: launchign Hardware manager, or programming with Vitis.
